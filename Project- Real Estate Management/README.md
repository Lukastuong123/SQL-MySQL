# Real Estate Management project
A real estate company is about to open on January 1, 2018, so the company needs to build a real estate transaction management system. The main business operations of the Company include:
- ABC Company posts the Company's real estate project to promote the brand and post the project trading floor.
- The individual who owns the property submits the project and must pay ABC Company a monthly maintenance fee of $ 9 / project. (Need to record this as well)
- ABC Company approves the contents of individual projects before making them to the trading floor
- External users can register the project for ownership by sending contact information to the project owner.
